Edmund is the release manager. Everyone else on the team forks the project main and clones it to their local machine. 
Then one creates a change branch, works there, and when satisfied with work merges with local main, and creates
a pull request from local main to project main for Edmund to accept and/or comment on. 

# The distribution of the workload is such:
-------------------------------------
-- Dustin will write a script which loads data from datasets and is in charge of the report structure.  
-- Paulina works on Example 3.1. Given a date (Month, Day) or the day of the year (Day) the result is a histogram of temperature of that given day.  
-- Anton works on Example 3.2. The result is a histogram with the temperature for every day of the year.  
-- Edmund is release manager. Edmund works a result that is not in the Examples. Calculating the covariance of temperatures between two cities. The result is a plot of the covariance between two cities.

Each person writes a report on their problem, presents the results produced and the approach used. For each result there should be at least one plot.
